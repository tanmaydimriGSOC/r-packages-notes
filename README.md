# Notes on R Packages

This repository contains my personal notes while learning and contributing
to R packages in the open-source ecosystem.

## Topics
- Understanding CRAN package structure
- Writing and reviewing vignettes
- Backward compatibility in R APIs
- Importance of not breaking existing behavior
- Learning from code reviews and rejected PRs

## Why this repo
I am preparing for open-source contributions and programs like GSoC.
This repo helps me document what I learn along the way.

## Why this package?

This package is created to help beginners understand how R packages are structured
and how functions, documentation, and examples work together.
